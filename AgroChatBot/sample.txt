Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, supporting the livelihood of over half of the country's population. Though its share of India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been declining due to broad-based economic growth, the sector remains demographically the broadest economic sector. Indian agriculture is transitioning from a traditional, grain-focused sector to a diversified, high-value one, a shift driven by changing consumer demands, government policies, and technological advancements.
Current trends and statistics (as of 2025)
Economic contribution: In 2023–24, agriculture and allied activities contributed 17.8% to India's GDP. In the first quarter of 2025–26, the sector recorded a significant growth of 3.7%.
Diversification: The sector is moving "from grain to gourmet," with a notable shift towards high-value horticulture, livestock, and fisheries. While cereals remain important, their share in the agricultural output value has shrunk, while the output value of fruits, vegetables, livestock, and millets ("Shree Anna") has grown significantly.
Record production:
Foodgrains: Production for 2024–25 was projected at a record 353.96 million tonnes, a steady increase over the last decade.
Rice: Production is expected to reach 149.074 million tonnes in 2024–25, a year-over-year increase of 11.249 million tonnes.
Horticulture: Output reached 367.72 million tonnes in 2024–25.
Agricultural exports: Exports of agricultural and allied products touched an all-time high of approximately US$51.86 billion in FY25.
Seed availability: The availability of certified and quality seeds was projected to reach 53.151 million quintals for 2024–25.
Rural credit: The government has set a target of ₹32.50 lakh crore for agricultural credit in 2025–26.
Government initiatives (2024–2025)
The government has introduced several schemes and policies aimed at modernizing the sector and improving farmer income, with budget allocations for the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare seeing a substantial increase.
Financial support:
PM-KISAN: Provides direct income support of ₹6,000 per year to eligible farmer families.
Kisan Credit Card (KCC): Under the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS), the loan limit has been enhanced from ₹3 lakh to ₹5 lakh, with interest rates as low as 4% for prompt repayment.
PM-KUSUM: Aims to make farmers energy self-reliant by providing subsidies for solar pumps and the installation of solar plants on barren land.
Risk management:
PM Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY): A crop insurance scheme providing comprehensive financial support for losses due to natural calamities.
PM Kisan Maan-dhan Yojana: A pension scheme for small and marginal farmers.
Infrastructure and market access:
Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF): Provides medium- to long-term debt financing for post-harvest management infrastructure.
e-NAM: A pan-India electronic trading portal connecting Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis to create a unified national market.
Natural and sustainable farming:
National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF): Aims to promote chemical-free farming among one crore farmers.
Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY): Supports organic farming through a cluster-based approach.
Specific crop missions:
National Mission on High-Yielding Seeds and Cotton Productivity (2025): Focuses on developing and propagating climate-resilient and high-yielding seed varieties.
Mission for Aatmanirbharta in Pulses (2025): Aims for self-reliance in pulse production over six years.
Challenges
Despite significant progress, Indian agriculture faces several hurdles:
Small and fragmented landholdings: Makes it difficult to implement modern and mechanized farming practices.
Climate change: The sector is vulnerable to unpredictable weather patterns, droughts, and floods.
Dependence on monsoons: A large portion of agriculture is still rain-fed, leading to high dependence on seasonal rainfall.
Input issues: Challenges include declining soil fertility, imbalanced use of fertilizers, and access to quality seeds and irrigation.
Infrastructure gaps: Inadequate storage, cold chain facilities, and connectivity lead to post-harvest losses and limited market access.
Low productivity: Yields for many crops remain low compared to global standards due to outdated farming techniques and limited access to technology.
Opportunities
The challenges also present key opportunities for growth:
Technological adoption: Leveraging technology like drones, AI-based sorting, satellite data, and digital platforms can enhance productivity and market access.
Agro-processing: There is huge potential for value-added products and expanding food processing capacity, which benefits farmers and reduces post-harvest waste.
Diversification: Focusing on high-value crops, millets, and allied sectors like dairy, fisheries, and horticulture can boost farmer income and meet changing consumer demands.
Sustainable practices: The growing global demand for organic products offers an opportunity for India to become a leader in organic and natural farming.
Rural entrepreneurship: Government initiatives like AgriSURE are supporting start-ups and rural enterprises, fostering innovation across the agricultural value chain.
